# Covid-19 App
This is a responsive website of Covid-19 to increase awareness of corona virus. The design was made by [Shamima-Nasrin](https://www.uistore.design/items/covid-19-landing-page-for-figma/) and I only made the app to practice my skills of NextJs, HTML, CSS and responsive web.

## Getting Started

1. First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
2. Create a new file named `env.local` and copy the content from `example.env.txt` to the file.

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
