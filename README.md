# Covid-19 App
This is a responsive web application of Covid-19 to increase awareness of corona virus. The design was made by [Shamima-Nasrin](https://www.uistore.design/items/covid-19-landing-page-for-figma/) and I only made the app to practice my skills of NextJs, HTML, CSS and responsive web application.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
